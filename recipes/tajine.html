        <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong> Cut the meat into chunks and chop the onions and carrots. Soak the dried apricots or prunes in warm water for a few minutes to soften.</li>
        <li><strong>Saute the Aromatics:</strong> In a tajine pot or heavy-bottomed pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until they are soft and translucent.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the meat and the spices:</strong> Add the meat to the pot and brown it on all sides. Sprinkle the tajine spice blend (cumin, coriander, ginger, cinnamon, saffron) over the meat and stir to coat evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Vegetables and Fruits:</strong> Add the chopped carrots and the soaked dried apricots or prunes to the pot. Pour in enough water or broth to cover the ingredients, then cover the pot with a lid.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer and Server:</strong> Reduce the heat to low and let the tajine simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the flavors are well combined. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired.</li>
