        <h3>What you will need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>450 gram of ground beef</li>
            <li>Butter according to your preference</li>
            <li>4 cups of milk</li>


        </ul>

        <h3> How to make it:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large pan, sauté diced onions and garlic until fragrant, then add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and seasonings, and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes. </li>
            <li><strong>Make the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a saucepan, melt butter and whisk in flour to form a roux. Gradually add milk, whisking continuously until the sauce thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagne:</strong> In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Layer lasagne noodles on top, followed by more meat sauce, a layer of béchamel sauce, and a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat these layers, finishing with a generous topping of cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Let the lasagne rest for about 15 minutes to set, then cut into slices and serve hot, garnished with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
